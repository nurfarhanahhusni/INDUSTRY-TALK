# Reflection üìù
## What I had gain during the talk ‚ú®:
During Industrial Talk 1, I learned more about ICT Jobs in Clarity Techworks SDN BHD. This discussion covers job scopes, work experience, technology, skills, and advice. In the ICT, effective communication skills are essential. As a professional in ICT jobs, I need to master both verbal and written communication to effectively convey complex technical information. Apart from that, networking is a crucial aspect of enhancing communication skills in ICT. In the rapidly changing world of information and communications technology, students should embrace new technologies, take part in development programs, and create networks with other people.

Students may keep informed about the most recent developments in the sector, share ideas, and obtain insightful knowledge. It also provides opportunities to build relationships, which can lead to potential mentorship or even job opportunities. Additionally, it offers chances to form connections that may result in career or mentorship possibilities.

## Improvemnet üí™:
As an improvement suggestion, i would suggest about practical demonstrations. Consider incorporating practical demonstrations or simulations to showcase certain technologies or jobs tasks relevent to ICT roles in details. This hands-on approach can make the information more tangible and memorable for students.

## Others ‚ú® :
In my view for the future, some ways to encourage the reflection is by build action planning. This will guide students in creating action plans based on the insights gained from the talk. As students we will identify the specific steps that can we take to develop the skills and knowledge needed for a career in ICT. This can include joining relevant clubs, pursuing certifications, or seeking internship opportunities.
